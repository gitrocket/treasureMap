This is a game where the user retrieves x and y coordinates from a treasure map using the mouse pointer.  The code is a good exercise for introducing event handler concepts.

Concepts covered:

-Centering a single image with CSS properties
-Responsive images vs. non-responsive images (in this case we want the image to be fixed width and non-responsive, or the coordinates will change each time the viewport is re-sized)
-Assigning an event handler
-Asynchronous coding
-Handling the page load event by assigning a function to the window.onload event so that the function will be invoked when the page is loaded
-The event object
-The onmousemove event
